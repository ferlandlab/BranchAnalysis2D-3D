# BranchAnalysis2D-3D
ImageJ plugin: performs morphometric analyses of structures with branching morphologies (e.g., neuronal dendritic spines, vascular morphology, and primary cilia)

The compiled version of this algorithm is located under the folder Fiji.app. Sample data sets are also provided in a separate folder labelled dataSets. Instructions on how to use the algorithm is present in the file readme.pdf. This functionality is now included with AutoSholl and we recommend downloading both together from https://github.com/ferlandlab/AutoSholl.

Source code is in the folder sourceCode.
